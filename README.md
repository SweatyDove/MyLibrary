This is my custom library for practice.

Some decisions while writing classes in this library may be not optimal. But I do all
things just for the practice, to find some narrow places in my understanding
of fundamental things... Sometimes I choose dangerous things (C-style arrays,
pure pointers and etc.) in order to face with problems of the usage of such
things.
