**Overview**

This is my custom library for practice.

Some decisions while writing classes in this library may be not optimal. But I do all
things just for the practice, to find some narrow places in my understanding
of fundamental things... Sometimes I choose dangerous things (C-style arrays,
pure pointers and etc.) in order to face with problems of the usage of such
things.


**Structure**
./Include			- directory for headers (.h). It should be specified as "include" when use this library
./Include/Implementations	- directory for the template implementations (.hpp).
./Sources			- directory for the sources (.cpp).
./Tests				- directory for the different tests.
./Library			- directory for the building library.


**How to use**
1) Go to './Library' dir, open terminal in it and run 'make'
